Hi there! I'm Mohammad Anas, a Data Scientist and Software Engineer passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. My journey began with a strong foundation in Data Science at FAST NUCES, where I honed my skills in software engineering, data analysis, and artificial intelligence. I have a keen interest in building robust applications, exploring GenAI technologies, and creating intuitive user experiences.

I currently work as an Associate Software Engineer at Dubizzle Labs, leading frontend and backend development projects. In addition to my professional endeavors, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, competing in AI competitions, and exploring cutting-edge advancements in AI and machine learning.

When Iâ€™m not coding or working on a project, you might find me on my favorite subreddit discussing the latest in tech and innovation
